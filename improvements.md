Finishing up:

-Maybe a new feature that shows a level for the user, and each time the user logs a set or completes a day or completes a week, or completes a mesocycle, they get varying experience, and that gets added to the user's experience, eventually leveling them up when a certain cap is hit, and either continuing to the next cap to level up again, or resetting the experience and setting a new cap to be hit for the next level up.

-Add good descriptive comments for every component
